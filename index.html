    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-grid">
        <p>Hi, I’m Rémi — I’m currently studying towards my masters degree in Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

        <p>I’m curious about how software and hardware work together, whether that’s the structure of a digital system or how things can be made to run more efficiently. That curiosity has led me to explore both aspects of my degree: I’ve worked on personal projects ranging from building websites and writing code to hands-on projects with physical hardware. I enjoy figuring out how to make systems work better, especially when there’s a mix of design and performance involved.</p>

        <p>This summer, I’ll be joining the Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA) at the University of Edinburgh for a research internship focused on hardware optimisation. I’ll be working on the Gemmini deep learning accelerator platform — an open-source systolic array designed to run AI workloads efficiently on RISC-V systems.
        My focus will be on analysing and improving system-level performance: exploring how architectural changes and hardware–software co-design can better support AI inference tasks. It’s a great chance to apply what I’ve learned about digital systems and low-level computing, and to contribute to an area where efficiency and design choices have a real impact on emerging technologies.</p>

        <p>Outside of uni, I like learning new tools and tech, trying out side projects, and generally just building stuff that seems interesting or useful. I get a lot out of projects that are both creative and grounded in how things actually work.</p>

        <p>This site is where I plan to share a bit of everything — from what I’ve built, to what I’ve learned, to where I might be headed next.</p>
